# malware-ico-removal-helper
Helps to remove malwares esp in wordpress sites. It helps to remove .ico virus files and also detects suspicious worms within infected php files.  
Saves a lot of time unless you want to do things manually. You just have to place the files in root folder and scan

* just run the scanme.php file to remove all the ico virus files
* Just run scanpattern.php file (you can change pattern from within code since every worn has a different pattern) to scan it. And then you see the list of files with a paticular pattern. 
You can just edit those files (by removing that pattern manually with caution.  )
